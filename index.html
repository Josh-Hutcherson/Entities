</h2>

  <h2>DEMENT:</h2>
  <p>
Dement will invert controls, Blur screen out, and play a clock chiming sound every 5 seconds.
Makes you do a brain minigame (puzzle to fix brain, fix within 30 seconds you survive) and will kill you if you fail the brain minigame.
Dement will spawn randomly during  <a href = "#CT">The Cortex Castle</a> , which is the second setting where the game takes place. 
    Additionally, it can also appear in The Archive of the Unspoken, which serves as the third location in the game.
When your character meets their demise, a captivating visual unfolds: the clock’s hands spin to 3:00, and the clock itself begins to melt,
    reminiscent of the iconic <a href = "https://www.bing.com/search?go=Search&q=salvidor+dali+clock+painting&qs=ds&form=QBRE">Salvidor Dali Painting</a>

<h2>BLACKOUT:</h2>
<p> Will set the screen to pitch black, and if you move at ALL you will die. This will last about ten seconds.
When you die the screen will turn white leaving black streaks to start filling the screen up.
  Resembles the Over the Garden Wall scene with Wirt falling through the ice in episode 8.
When everything turns black, 
  a face resembling the <a href = "https://www.bing.com/search?q=no+players+online+entity&PC=U316&FORM=CHROMN">NO PLAYERS ONLINE</a> entity peeks out from the darkness.
Blackout will spawn randomly at the <a href = "#CD">Cerebellum docks
</a></p>

<h2>SADNESS:</h2>
<p>When Sadness is there the screen turns <a id = "blue">blue</a>
You find yourself in a four-way room. 
  Choose wisely: if you pick the right path, you’ll return to the castle; if you choose wrong, you’ll end up in another four-way room, repeating the process. 
  The entire sequence lasts about 30 seconds, and your speed is increased, so no need to worry about walking too slowly. 
  However, be aware that Sadness randomly appears in The Cortex Castle, and her crying echoes in the background.
  If you fail, Sadness grabs you, screams, and the screen goes black. It’s reminiscent of <a href = https://www.bing.com/search?q=scp-096&PC=U316&FORM=CHROMN>SCP-096</a>.

<h2>PAST:</h2>
<p>In the eerie halls of the <a href = "#archive"> Archive of the Unspoken</a>, two massive doors mark the entrance to where Past resides. 
  Once inside the dining room, Past remains dormant unless you dare to touch the food on the table. 
  A cutscene unfolds as you consume the meal, awakening Past. 
  Now, your escape begins—a frantic parkour chase, dodging falling objects from above. 
Past, when it claims you, a mirror reveals your skeletal reflection. 
  The pale man’s eyes from Pan’s Labyrinth adorn Past, but its unique features—mirror face and body—symbolize the haunting truth: what you flee is yourself.

<h2>CAPTAIN EQUILIBRIA:</h2>
<p>Captain Equilibria, an ethereal figure, dons a tattered captain’s coat that flows like underwater currents. 
  Their face remains veiled in mist, and their eyes emit a soft, unwavering glow—a symbol of balance and control. 
  As the guardian of the <a href = "#CD"> Cerebellum Docks </a>, the fourth game location, Captain Equilibria aids players in navigating physical coordination challenges.
  They steer ships through fog, each vessel representing distinct motor skills.
  Players learn to master fine control, overcoming obstacles in misty waters. 
  The ultimate test: synchronizing movements with the captain’s commands, mirroring the cerebellum’s role in motor precision.
  In a poignant cutscene, Captain meets their fate alongside their ship.(What if the twist is Captain Equilibria is the leading thought???)

<h2>NEUROXUS:</h2>
<p>Neuroxus, a shadowy and ever-shifting figure, embodies the fluidity of thoughts.
  Its tendrils of dark mist symbolize the grip of negativity on the mind. 
  At its core pulses a brain, signifying dominion over the mental realm. 
  Born from subconscious fears, Neuroxus thrives within the protagonist’s coma, feeding off their inability to awaken.
  The climactic showdown occurs at the <a href = "#SC">Summit of consciousness</a>, the final locale in the enigmatic world of Echoes. 
  Here, tranquility envelops the protagonist. Instead of a battle, a profound dialogue unfolds—a test of willpower.
  Just as victory Is assured, there's a blinding light, and a faint whisper from the Leading Thought saying: "Not yet. This is not the end, only the beginning."
  Then there is ending music and the game ends.
